## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze ITC's stock market data, including metrics like daily price changes, moving averages, monthly aggregates, trading volumes, turnovers, and deliverable volumes. The report provides actionable insights for stakeholders using SQL-based data preparation and Power BI visualizations

### Key Objectives:
1. Evaluate ITC's stock performance trends over time.
2. Identify high-volume trading days and periods of volatility.
3. Analyze liquidity and deliverable volumes as a percentage of total trading volume.
4. Present actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.
